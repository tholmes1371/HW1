	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<br clear="all">
	</div>
		<div id="backbox">
		<p>I was born on a farm in Oregon, but spent most of my childhood living in Michigan. I joined the Marines in 2001, shortly after 9/11.
		I spent 7 of the next 12 years deployed overseas. I was lucky to have the opportunity to do many things during my enlistment. I fought in the war in Iraq in 2004.
		I guarded U.S. Embassy's in Singapore, Ivory Coast, and Liberia and deployed aboard the USS Bataan to the Mediterranean Sea. I am greatful for all the experiences I had
		all over the world. </p>
		
		<p> In 2009 while stationed in Liberia, I met my wife and we began the next chapter in our lives. I got out of the Marines, went back to school, and we had a daughter named Everly. My wife is pregnant and we are expecting our next child in March of next year. We just found out that we will be having another girl. My wife and I are already starting the daunting task of coming up with new names. I started my undergraduate education at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. I spent 2 years at GW before we decided to move to Iowa. I transferred to the University of Iowa in the Summer of 2016, and I will graduate in the Spring of 2017. After I graduate, we plan to move to Tampa, FL.
