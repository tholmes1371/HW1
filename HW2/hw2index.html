	<h2> About Me </h2>

	</div>
		<div id="backbox">
		<p>I was born on a farm in Oregon, but spent most of my childhood living in Michigan. I joined the Marines in 2001, shortly after 9/11.
		I spent 7 of the next 12 years deployed overseas. I was lucky to have the opportunity to do many things during my enlistment. I fought in the war in Iraq in 2004.
		I guarded U.S. Embassy's in Singapore, Ivory Coast, and Liberia and deployed aboard the USS Bataan to the Mediterranean Sea. I am greatful for all the experiences I had
		all over the world. </p>
		
		<p> In 2009 while stationed in Liberia, I met my wife and we began the next chapter in our lives. I got out of the Marines, went back to school, and we had a daughter named Everly. My wife is
		 pregnant and we are expecting our next child in March of next year. We should find out if it is a boy or a girl within the next week, which is always an exciting time.
		I started my undergraduate education at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. I spent 2 years at GW before we decided to move to Iowa. I transferred to the
		University of Iowa in the Summer of 2016, and I will graduate in the Spring of 2017. After I graduate, we plan to move to Tampa, FL.
